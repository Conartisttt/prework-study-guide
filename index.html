        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language</li>
          <li>HTML elements work together to build the structure of a webpage, and provide a framework that makes it easy for users to navigate the webpage.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>This can be text, images, or parts of a page's layout</li>
          </ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage. Elements included within the head element are not visible when a user looks at a webpage. It is metadata.</head></li>
          <li>Metadata is data about our webpage that the broswer uses to effectively serve our webpage to users.</li>
          <li>Inside the head elements, we can use the following metadata tags:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>title: defines the title for the webpage. This element is required and is extremely important for Search Engine Optimiziation.</li>
              <li>style: defines the CSS styles associated with a website.</li>
              <li>base: defines the base URL for a webpage.</li>
              <li>link: connects an external resource to the HTML document.</li>
              <li>meta: defines metadata such as the character set, description, keywords, author, and viewport.</li>
              <li>script: embeds client-side scripts in the HTML document.</li>

            </ul>
          <li>The body elements represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.</li>
          <li>This language is used to describe the presentaiton of a website that's created with HTML, and how each element on the page is rendered</li>
          <ul>
            <li>This might include fonts, colors, and spacing</li>
          </ul>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>

        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Git is a free, open source version control system that allows web developers to collaborate on projects without overwriting each other's work. It also allows developers to rever to previous verions of the code if a problem is discovered.
          <li>GitHub is the largest provider of internet hosting for software and web development code, and provides the version control functionality of Git in a central repository</li>
          </li>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>JS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>JS stands for JavaScript.</li>
          <li>This language is used to provide logic and interactivity for websites.</li>
          <li>Variable: a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>Control flow: the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>Conditional logic:</li>
          <li>Arrays:</li>

        <h2>Other Concepts & Terminology</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>User story: a short description of the user you're creating an application for. It consists of the following three sections:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>The type of person using your application.</li>
            <li>What the user wants from the application.</li>
            <li>Why the user wants what they want. What problem are they trying to solve?</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Acceptance criteria: a list of the things that your application must acheive in order to be considred done.</li>
          <li>Computational thinking: the process of understanding a complex problem by breaking that problem into smaller parts, and then developing possible solutions that can be clearly presented in a way that comupters and/or humans can understand. There are four cornerstones:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Decomposition: breaking down the problem into smaller tasks</li>
            <li>Pattern recognition: thinking about how we've solved subtasks previously, and finding any patterns that might help us to solve this particular problem.</li>
            <li>Abstraction: make sure that we are only focusing on relevant information, and that we are disregarding details that won't help us solve this problem.</li>
            <li>Testing and debugging algorithms: an algorithm is a sequence of steps or rules that we can use to solve our problem. Changing our original algorithm after finding a mistake or a potenial mistake in our code is called debugging.</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Event trigger: an association between a predefined event, and the script that is to be executed when that event occurs.</li>
          <li>Conditional statement: allow us to make decisions based on conditions in our code.</li>
          <li>For loop: an action that will repeat over and over again until a condition is met.</li>
          <li>Agile software development, AKA agile: a framework that helps developers handle change and uncertainty during the development process.</li>
          <li>Command line interface, or CLI: a command-line program that allows us to input text commands to execute operating system functions, like opening a file or creating a new folder.</li>
          <li>Graphical user interface, or GUI: includes icons and menus that allow users to navigate their system by using a mouse, touchpad, or assistive technology.</li>
          <li>Terminal: the application that allows us to interact with the shell.</li>
          <li>Shell: the software that interprets and executes the various commands that we type in the terminal.</li>
          <li>Bash, or Bash commands: this term is used to describe the shell and the types of commands that we will use. Bash is just a popular version of a shell that will allow us to perform many tasks from the command line inside the terminal.</li>
          <li>Homebrew: a package manager that makes it easy to install and update applications on macOS.</li>
          <li>Package: contains code written by others that we can add to and use on our computers and in our projects.</li>
          <li>Package manager: automates the process of isntalling, updating, configuring, and removing packages.</li>
