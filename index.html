        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="bolded">HTML</span> stands for Hypertext Markup Language</li>
          <li>HTML elements work together to build the structure of a webpage, and provide a framework that makes it easy for users to navigate the webpage.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>This can be text, images, or parts of a page's layout</li>
          </ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage. Elements included within the head element are not visible when a user looks at a webpage. It is metadata.</head></li>
          <li>Metadata is data about our webpage that the broswer uses to effectively serve our webpage to users.</li>
          <li>Inside the head elements, we can use the following metadata tags:</li>
            <ul>
              <li><span class="bolded">title:</span> defines the title for the webpage. This element is required and is extremely important for Search Engine Optimiziation.</li>
              <li><span class="bolded">style:</span> defines the CSS styles associated with a website.</li>
              <li><span class="bolded">base:</span> defines the base URL for a webpage.</li>
              <li><span class="bolded">link:</span> connects an external resource to the HTML document.</li>
              <li><span class="bolded">meta:</span> defines metadata such as the character set, description, keywords, author, and viewport.</li>
              <li><span class="bolded">script:</span> embeds client-side scripts in the HTML document.</li>

            </ul>
          <li>The body elements represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.</li>
          <li>This language is used to describe the presentaiton of a website that's created with HTML, and how each element on the page is rendered</li>
          <ul>
            <li>This might include fonts, colors, and spacing</li>
          </ul>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="bolded">class attribute</span> can be assigned to any viewable HTML element. It is used to assign a CSS class to items and can be used for mulitiple items.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>class is represented by a . in CSS</li>
          </ul>
          <li><span class="bolded">id attribute</span> can be assigned to only one single viewable HTML element. It's value is always unique per webpage and cannot be usued for multiple items.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>id is represented by a # is CSS</li>
          </ul>

        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Git is software on your computer that tracks changes that you make to your code.</li>
          <li>GitHub is a cloud-based service that allows developers to store, manage, and collaborate on code inside repositories. It is connected to Git.</li>
          <li>Repositories, or repos: used as folders to store the following:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Files that contain code.</li>
              <li>Files that contain other information about the code, like a README file.</li>
              <li>The version history for all of the files in the repository.</li>
            </ul>
          
          <li>Git commands: always start with git, and are used to save and track versions of your code. Using git commands, we can initaiate or create a repo, add our code to the repo, and view the different versions of our code, which are each stored in a unique commit.</li>
          <ul>
            <li><span class="bolded">git revert</span> command, followed by the SHA, is used to revert a project back to an older version. This is often used after discovering a bug in your code.</li>
            <li><span class="bolded">git status</span> command checks what branch we are currently on</li>
            <li><span class="bolded">git checkout -b branch-name</span> command creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
            <li>After making changes to a branch in VS Code, you need to sync your working branch back to the main branch. This is called the git flow.</li>
            <li>Performing the Git flow:</li>
            <ul>
              <li><span class="bolded">git add -A</span> command to stage a commit for all files in the working branch.</li>
              <li><span class="bolded">git commit -m "insert description here"</span> command commits any changes with a short descriptive message of the changes implemented.</li>
              <li><span class="bolded">git pull origin main</span> command pulls the base branch into our feature branch so that it is syncing with the most up to date version in the repo</li>
              <li><span class="bolded">git push origin "branch-name"</span> command pushes all of our changes up to the repository on GitHub to be pulled in</li>
              <li>Navigate to your repository on GitHub. Click "Pull Requests" tab and then the "New pull request" button.</li>
              <li>Make sure the base branch is main and the comparison branch is the feature branch you just updated. Add a title for the pull request along with a short description of the changes.</li>
              <li>Click the "Create pull request" button.</li>
              <li>Now we can merge the comparison branch into the base branch by selecting the "Merge pull request" button and then confirming the merge request.</li>
              <li>If you had an issue open on GitHub for this change, you can now navigate to this issue, and close it.</li>
              <li>Now, make sure you update the local main branch. Back in the command line, navigate to the main branch by entering: git checkout main</li>
              <li>Then pull the remote main branch into the local main branch by entering: git pull origin main</li>
            </ul>

          <li><span class="bolded">Index:</span> a unique number given to each individual data inside an array</li>
          <li><span class="bolded">Loops:</span> a sequence of instructions that is continually repeated until a certain condition is reached.</li>
          <li><span class="bolded">Function:</span> simply a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a task. A function must be called on if we want it to execute.</li>
          <li>Use /* java script code is here */ to comment out code. This makes it inactive without deleting it, in case we need it again later.</li>

        <h2>Other Concepts & Terminology</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>User story: a short description of the user you're creating an application for. It consists of the following three sections:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>The type of person using your application.</li>
            <li>What the user wants from the application.</li>
            <li>Why the user wants what they want. What problem are they trying to solve?</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Acceptance criteria: a list of the things that your application must acheive in order to be considred done.</li>
          <li>Computational thinking: the process of understanding a complex problem by breaking that problem into smaller parts, and then developing possible solutions that can be clearly presented in a way that comupters and/or humans can understand. There are four cornerstones:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Decomposition: breaking down the problem into smaller tasks</li>
            <li>Pattern recognition: thinking about how we've solved subtasks previously, and finding any patterns that might help us to solve this particular problem.</li>
            <li>Abstraction: make sure that we are only focusing on relevant information, and that we are disregarding details that won't help us solve this problem.</li>
            <li>Testing and debugging algorithms: an algorithm is a sequence of steps or rules that we can use to solve our problem. Changing our original algorithm after finding a mistake or a potenial mistake in our code is called debugging.</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Event trigger: an association between a predefined event, and the script that is to be executed when that event occurs.</li>
          <li>Conditional statement: allow us to make decisions based on conditions in our code.</li>
          <li>For loop: an action that will repeat over and over again until a condition is met.</li>
          <li>Agile software development, AKA agile: a framework that helps developers handle change and uncertainty during the development process.</li>
          <li>Command line interface, or CLI: a command-line program that allows us to input text commands to execute operating system functions, like opening a file or creating a new folder. Here are a commands to remember:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>ls: allows uss to see a list of files and directories on our computer, or in the current directory we are in.</li>
            <li>cd: "change directories" will allow us to change directories. Type the directory you would like to change to after using this command, and press enter.</li>
            <li>cd..: allows us to navigate backwards one directory at a time.</li>
            <li>pwd: "print working directory" will print out the directory that we are currently in to the terminal.</li>
            <li>mkdir: creates a directory. Type the name of the directory you would like to create after this command, and press enter.</li>
            <li>touch: creates a new file. Type the name of the file you would like to create.type of file, and press enter.</li>
            <li>open: opens a file. Type the name of the file you would like to open after this command, and press enter.</li>
           </ul>
          <li>Graphical user interface, or GUI: includes icons and menus that allow users to navigate their system by using a mouse, touchpad, or assistive technology.</li>
          <li>Terminal: the application that allows us to interact with the shell.</li>
          <li>Shell: the software that interprets and executes the various commands that we type in the terminal.</li>
          <li>Bash, or Bash commands: this term is used to describe the shell and the types of commands that we will use. Bash is just a popular version of a shell that will allow us to perform many tasks from the command line inside the terminal.</li>
          <li>Homebrew: a package manager that makes it easy to install and update applications on macOS.</li>
          <li>Package: contains code written by others that we can add to and use on our computers and in our projects.</li>
          <li>Package manager: automates the process of isntalling, updating, configuring, and removing packages.</li>
          <li>Pair programming: occurs when two developers collaborate on a feature or a project.</li>
          <li>Driver-navigator model: one of the most common pair programming strategies. One developer uses a keyboard to type the code, known as the driver. The other developer is responsible for the overall direction that the pair decides to go, known as the navigator.</li>
          <li>SSH key: an access credential for the secure shell, SSH, network protocol. Generating SSH keys allows developers to interface with certain remote services without having to constantly retype login information.</li>
          <li>SSH agent: a program that keeps track of a user's identity keys and passphrases.</li>
          <li>Web development project: a web application, or web app, that provides a solution to a real-world problem.</li>
          <li>Minimum viable product, or MVP: this is usually the first iteration of a product without extra features. It is the first version that fulfills the requirements and proves that the solution to the program works.</li>
          <li>Version control systems: allow us to track and manage changes to our codebase. Git is the most commonly used version control software among developers.</li>
          <li>SHA, or hash: a unique identifier that allows us to keep a record of the specific changes committed to version control.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>SHA is actually a long string of numbers, or letters. Developers often type out only the first seven numbers or letters.</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Control flow: the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
        </ul>
